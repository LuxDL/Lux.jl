The documentation for this page has been moved to [LuxCore.jl](../lib/LuxCore/api.md).
However, this the functionality has in **no way been deprecated** and there is no plan
to deprecated access to these functionalities in the future. The change was made merely to
allow lighter dependencies for users extending `Lux.jl`.
