# Experimental Features

All features listed on this page are **experimental** which means:

1. No SemVer Guarantees. We use code here to iterate fast. That said, historically we have
   never broken any code in this module and have always provided a deprecation period.
2. Expect edge-cases and report them. It will help us move these features out of
   experimental sooner.
3. None of the features are exported.
