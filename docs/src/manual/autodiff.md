# [Automatic Differentiation](@id autodiff-lux)

Lux is not an AD package, but it composes well with most of the AD packages available in the
Julia ecosystem. This document lists the current level of support for various AD packages in
Lux. Additionally, we provide some convenience functions for working with AD.

## Overview

[^e]: Currently Enzyme outperforms other AD packages in terms of CPU performance. However,
      there are some edge cases where it might not work with Lux when not using Reactant. We are working on
      improving the compatibility. Please report any issues you encounter and try Reactant if something fails.

[^q]: This feature is supported downstream, but we don't extensively test it to ensure
      that it works with Lux.

[^cr]: Note that `ChainRules.jl` is not really an AD package, but we have first-class
       support for packages that use `rrules`.

[^re]: Note that `Reactant.jl` is not really an AD package, but a tool for compiling functions, including the use of EnzymeMLIR for AD via `Enzyme.jl`.
       We have first-class support for the usage of `Reactant.jl` for inference and training when using `Enzyme.jl` for differentiation.

## [Recommendations](@id autodiff-recommendations)

  * For CPU Usacases:

    1. Use `Reactant.jl` + `Enzyme.jl` for the best performance as well as mutation-support.
       When available, this is the most reliable and fastest option.
    2. Use `Zygote.jl` for the best performance without `Reactant.jl`. This is the most reliable and fastest
       option for CPU for the time-being. (We are working on faster Enzyme support for CPU)
    3. Use `Enzyme.jl`, if there are mutations in the code and/or `Zygote.jl` fails.
    4. If `Enzyme.jl` fails for some reason, (open an issue and) try
       `ReverseDiff.jl` ([possibly with compiled mode](https://juliadiff.org/ReverseDiff.jl/dev/api/#ReverseDiff.compile)).

  * For GPU Usacases:

    1. Use `Reactant.jl` + `Enzyme.jl` for the best performance. This is the most reliable and fastest option, but presently
       only supports NVIDIA GPU's. AMD GPUs are currently not supported.
    2. Use `Zygote.jl` for the best performance on non-NVIDIA GPUs. This is the most reliable and fastest
       non-`Reactant.jl` option for GPU for the time-being. We are working on supporting `Enzyme.jl` without
       `Reactant.jl` for GPU as well.

  * For TPU Usacases:
    1. Use `Reactant.jl`. This is the only supported (and fastest) option.

## Support Class

  1. **Tier I**: These packages are fully supported and have been tested extensively. Often
     have special rules to enhance performance. Issues for these backends take the highest
     priority.
  2. **Tier II**: These packages are supported and extensively tested but often don't have
     the best performance. Issues against these backends are less critical, but we fix them
     when possible. (Some specific edge cases, especially with AMDGPU, are known to fail
     here)
  3. **Tier III**: We don't know if these packages currently work with Lux. We'd love to
     add tests for these backends, but currently these are not our priority.
