# Why we wrote Lux?

Julia already has quite a few well established Neural Network Frameworks --
[Flux](https://fluxml.ai/) & [KNet](https://denizyuret.github.io/Knet.jl/latest/). However,
certain design elements -- **Coupled Model and Parameters** & **Internal Mutations** --
associated with these frameworks make them less compiler and user friendly. Making changes
to address these problems in the respective frameworks would be too disruptive for users.
Here comes in `Lux`: a neural network framework built completely using pure functions to make
it both compiler and autodiff friendly.

## Design Principles

* **Layers must be immutable** -- cannot store any parameter/state but rather store the
  information to construct them
* **Layers are pure functions**
* **Layers return a Tuple containing the result and the updated state**
* **Given same inputs the outputs must be same** -- yes this must hold true even for
  stochastic functions. Randomness must be controlled using `rng`s passed in the state.
* **Easily extensible**

## Why use Lux over Flux?

* **Neural Networks for SciML**: For SciML Applications (Neural ODEs, Deep Equilibrium
  Models) solvers typically expect a monolithic parameter vector. Flux enables this via its
  `destructure` mechanism, but `destructure` comes with various
  [edge cases and limitations](https://fluxml.ai/Optimisers.jl/dev/api/#Optimisers.destructure). Lux
  forces users to make an explicit distinction between state variables and parameter
  variables to avoid these issues. Also, it comes battery-included for distributed training
  using [FluxMPI.jl](https://github.com/avik-pal/FluxMPI.jl) *(I know :P the naming)*
  
* **Sensible display of Custom Layers** -- Ever wanted to see Pytorch like Network printouts
  or wondered how to extend the pretty printing of Flux's layers? Lux handles all of that
  by default.
  
* **Truly immutable models** - No *unexpected internal mutations* since all layers are
  implemented as pure functions. All layers are also *deterministic* given the parameters and
  state: if a layer is supposed to be stochastic (say `Dropout`), the state must contain a
  seed which is then updated after the function call.

* **Easy Parameter Manipulation** -- By separating parameter data and layer structures,
  Lux makes implementing `WeightNorm`, `SpectralNorm`, etc. downright trivial.
  Without this separation, it is much harder to pass such parameters
  around without mutations which AD systems don't like.

## Why not use Lux?

* **Small Neural Networks on CPU** -- Lux is developed for training large neural networks.
  For smaller architectures, we recommend using
  [SimpleChains.jl](https://github.com/PumasAI/SimpleChains.jl).

* **Lux won't magically speed up your code (yet)** -- Lux shares the same backend with Flux
  and so if your primary desire to shift is driven by performance, you will be disappointed.

* **XLA Support** -- Lux doesn't compile to XLA which means no TPU support unfortunately.
