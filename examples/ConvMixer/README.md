# Train ConvMixer on CIFAR-10

This is a simple ConvMixer training script for CIFAR-10. It's probably a good starting point
for new experiments on small datasets.

You can get around **90.0%** accuracy in just **25 epochs** by running the script with the
following arguments, which trains a ConvMixer-256/8 with kernel size 5 and patch size 2.

```bash
julia --startup-file=no \
    --project=. \
    --threads=auto \
    main.jl \
    --lr-max=0.05 \
    --weight-decay=0.0001
```

Here's an example of the output of the above command (on a V100 32GB GPU):

## Notes

  1. To match the results from the original repo, we need more augmentation strategies, that
     are currently not implemented in DataAugmentation.jl.
  2. Don't compare the reported timings in that repo against the numbers here. They time the
     entire loop. We only time the training part of the loop.
