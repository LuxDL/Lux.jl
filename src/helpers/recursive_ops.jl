!!! warning "Deprecation Warning"

    Starting Lux v1.3.0, this function is deprecated in favor of `Functors.fmap`. Functors
    v0.5 made significant strides towards improving the performance of `fmap` and hence
    this function has been deprecated. Users are encouraged to use `Functors.fmap` instead.

    recursive_add!!(x, y)

Recursively add the leaves of two nested structures `x` and `y`. In Functor language, this
is equivalent to doing `fmap(+, x, y)`, but this implementation uses type stable code for
common cases.

Any leaves of `x` that are arrays and allow in-place addition will be modified in place.

    recursive_eltype(x, unwrap_ad_types = Val(false))

Recursively determine the element type of a nested structure `x`. This is equivalent to
doing `fmap(Lux.Utils.eltype, x)`, but this implementation uses type stable code for common
cases.

For ambiguous inputs like `nothing` and `Val` types we return `Bool` as the eltype.

If `unwrap_ad_types` is set to `Val(true)` then for tracing and operator overloading based
ADs (ForwardDiff, ReverseDiff, Tracker), this function will return the eltype of the
unwrapped value.

    recursive_map(f, x, args...)

Similar to `fmap(f, args...)` but with restricted support for the notion of "leaf" types.
However, this allows for more efficient and type stable implementations of recursive
operations.

$(RECURSIVE_OPS_DEPRECATION_MSG)

## How this works?

For the following types it directly defines recursion rules:

 1. `AbstractArray`: If eltype is `isbitstype`, then `f` is applied to the array, else we
    recurse on the array.
 2. `Tuple/NamedTuple`: We recurse on the values.
 3. `Number/Val/Nothing`: We directly apply `f`.
 4. For all other types, we recurse on the fields using `Functors.fmap`.

!!! note

    In most cases, users should gravitate towards `Functors.fmap` if it is being used
    outside of hot loops. Even for other cases, it is always recommended to verify the
    correctness of this implementation for specific usecases.
